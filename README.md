# tomcat-helper
Helps me start/stop tomcat server and move ready war package from work directory to "webapps" folder of root server directory in semi-automatic mode.

It works good when you have InteliJ IDEA Community, want to create and debug Spring MVC Apps and don't want manually move war package to "webapps" folder and to start/stop TomCat Server every time you need to test your app.

Start this helper by command: <br>
<code>py main.py</code>
